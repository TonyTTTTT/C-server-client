Don’t feel too sorry for Hong Kong’s two bronze medalists, as they were rewarded with HK$1.5 million (over $190,000) for their efforts. All the medal winners can also look forward to free railway tickets for life, courtesy of railway giant MTR.

However, these are far from the most generous payouts available to Olympic athletes.

Saudi Arabia is yet to win an Olympic gold medal, but whichever athlete does so first can look forward to a hefty pay day. Five million riyals (approximately $1.3 million) is promised to any Saudi Olympic champion, according to Reuters.

Student athlete Tareg Hamedi became a millionaire overnight when he won a karate silver medal for Saudi Arabia in the 2020 Games in Tokyo and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman decided he had earned the reward promised to gold medalists.

Asia is arguably the most generous continent to its athletes, with six of the top 10 payouts from this year’s olympics coming from there. Georgia is the only European country to make it into the top 10, with Serbia’s €200,000 (about $223,500) and Italy’s €180,000 (roughly $200,000) for gold medalists just missing out.

Countries tend to be more generous to victorious athletes when the nation has less history of success.

Filipino gymnast Carlos Edriel Yulo won two gold medals in Paris – the only golds ever won by a male Filipino athlete. As a result, he was awarded 10 million pesos, around $178,300, by the government.
